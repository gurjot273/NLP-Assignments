        "**Answer here:** Stemming is a normalization technique for words which works mostly by cutting off the end or the beginning of the word, taking into account a list of common prefixes and suffixes that can be found in an inflected word, while Lemmatization takes into consideration the morphological analysis of words and returns the base or dictionary form of a word depending on its meaning. Lemmatization takes into account the part of speech of a word and the normalization rules vary for different parts of speech, while Stemming operates on a single word without knowledge of context, and therefore cannot discriminate between words which have different meanings depending on part of speech. In stemming, the stem may not be a valid word, while lemmatization returns the dictionary form of a word, which must be valid.\n",
